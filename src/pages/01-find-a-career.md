<p>When I was very little my parents asked, "What do you want to be when you grow up?"  I am sure I had a very cute answer that included an illustrious career. Then in kindergarten there was an entire day dedicated to my classmates and I presenting what we were going to be.  "Fireman!" was my reply.  Next, in grade school and thanks to Dr. Henry Walton Jones Jr, also known as "Indiana," I spent my days dreaming of being an archaeologist unearthing long forgotten civilizations and puzzling over the why and how of where they went.  So when I was a senior in high school, my guidance counselor asked me this question again and for fear of being embarrassed for not having an answer I blurted out, "businessman." Seriously, just said it. I did not know what people who were in business actually did, but I knew they wore suits and most of my fellow classmates said they were going into business. I assumed I was in good company.</p>

<p>Fast forward to day one of my macroeconomics class. First semester of college.  Topics include how levels of income and production and the rates of inflation and unemployment are determined, consider how economic activity is affected by the federal government’s taxing and spending policies and by the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy practices...  Seriously? Businessman? </p>

<p>Email from College Advisor's Office:
Dear Mr. Tardif,
With only one week remaining before the end of your sophomore year, you must declare a major in order to meet graduation requirements within four years. Please complete this before Friday.  

Hmmmmm. What to be, what to be?  With a few days of deliberation and nothing coming to mind, I ended up selecting English as a major with a minor in communications. I can read, study literature, and write. Perfect. My path is set and </p>



<p>These decisions ultimately led to 9 years of teaching high school English.  I loved the work. It was difficult, challenging, and rewarding, but I knew I could not do it forever. Building relationships with teenagers while persuading them to read and write about literature was not how I wanted to spend the remainder of my days. </p>

<p>In 2011 with 7 years into my teaching career, I moved to Denver, CO. A fresh start in a new city was going to be the deciding factor in whether to cut the cord on my teaching career. I remember sitting in my classroom after a challenging period and checking my email. I came across a headline stating "Learn Ruby on Rails." I was beginning to get more intrigued in web development as one of my former colleagues had shown me some basic web development a few years previous. I spent abotu 15 minutes walking through Codecadamy's tutorials. After a few minutes completing what felt like disjointed exercises, I closed the browser.</p>

<p>How the enticing appeal of the word Dreamweaver opened doors to my future.
Fast forward to Dreamweaver and SQL.</p>
